## Human Detection Model

This model gives prediction that there is a human on a picture, it can be used to process video stream from CCTV cameras.
The basis of a model is a neural network with LeNet-based architecture. Model is avaible as colab notebook, as pytorch model saved with state_dict() method and as GUI application.

## Get started

### Google Colab

Just run .ipynb file

### Load pytorch model




## Dataset 

Dataset contains CCTV footage images(as indoor as outdoor), 552 of them with humans and 462 without them.
