The Transformer is a deep machine learning model introduced in 2017 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). Like 
recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Transformers are designed to handle ordered sequences of data, such as natural language, 
for various tasks such as  machine translation and text summarization. However, unlike RNNs, Transformers do not require 
that the sequence be processed in order. This fact allows to parallelize computation.
